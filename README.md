# elife-formula PRIVATE

These are the 'base' states from the original `elife-builder`.

This repository is currently ***PRIVATE*** until we have the new
open source builder sorted and working.

1. get this formula working standalone with new builder
2. create a `pillar.example` file from the final pillar.sls file
3. move the final pillar data into a private repo
4. add licence
5. re-create this repo, destroying it's history
